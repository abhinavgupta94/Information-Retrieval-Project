# Information-Retrieval-Project
•	We used the 20 newsgroups dataset and mixed several classes together. Then we cluster the corpus using k-means.
•	Then we took the top k-terms from each cluster and searched them in Wikipedia to get more related terms and groups. Then with the help of NLP, we gave the label to each cluster using trigram model.
